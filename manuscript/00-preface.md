# Preface

Software development has transformed dramatically in the last decade. Modern systems are no longer built as large monoliths running on a single server—they are composed of distributed microservices, containerized workloads, cloud-native architectures, asynchronous messaging, artificial intelligence, and continuously evolving pipelines that ship software faster than ever before.

Yet, despite all this progress, one problem remains:  
**the industry still struggles with building real, production-grade systems with clarity, structure, and maintainability.**

This book was written to solve that.

Instead of teaching microservices by theory, this book takes a practical, hands-on approach:  
**we build a full Banking Suite from the ground up**, one microservice at a time.  
We write real code.  
We write real tests.  
We use real tooling.  
We build real CI/CD.  
We containerize everything.  
We deploy using real pipelines.  
We design real domains using DDD and clean architecture.  
And we prepare every microservice for production—not just for demo purposes.

This book is not only a technical reference; it’s a blueprint for how to architect modern, scalable systems that stand the test of time.

If you're a developer, architect, or engineering lead looking to elevate your craft, this book is for you.  
If you enjoy learning by building something real, challenging, and valuable, this book is for you.  
If you want to see how enterprise-grade systems are designed in the real world—welcome.

Let’s begin.
